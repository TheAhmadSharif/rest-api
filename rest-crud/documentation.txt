PUT Vs Patch



https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21660791/what-is-the-main-difference-between-patch-and-put-request


PUT => If user can update all or just a portion of the record, use PUT (user controls what gets updated)


PATCH => If user can only update a partial record, say just an email address (application controls what can be updated), use PATCH.


PUT method need more bandwidth or handle full resources instead on partial. So PATCH was introduced to reduce the bandwidth.

Explanation about PATCH

PATCH is a method that is not safe, nor idempotent, and allows full and partial updates and side-effects on other resources.
